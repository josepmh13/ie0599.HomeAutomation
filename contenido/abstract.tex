This project describes the study and implementation of an omnidirectional robot odometry with four swedish wheels of \si{45\degree} (mecanum). This was achieved from the data of the wheels angular velocity obtained the encoders and with the direct kinematics model of the plataform. In this way, it was possible to determine the global position evolution in time of the mobile platform.
